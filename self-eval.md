# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
It felt good to put everything together again. I really enjoy putting all of my knowledge to the test and finding work arounds. I did need to reference my notes for these exercises, but I'm happy to say that I was able to get the hang of it fairly quickly.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
Because this is my second jaunt through mod 0, I have been taking fewer breaks and really committing to sitting down and finishing an assignment in one go. I have been taking breaks between file exercises though and that has helped. 

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
For this exercise I really want to remember how to make classes and utilize the attr reader ability. I didn't utilize it that much on my first round through mod 0 until I get tutoring on the usefulness of the attr reader. So for mod 1 I really want to make sure I know all that I can about classes and their syntax before getting into projects that require that knowledge.
